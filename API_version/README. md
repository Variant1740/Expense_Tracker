##**Expense Tracker API (FastAPI Version)**

**Overview

This project is a RESTful Expense Tracker API built with FastAPI. It is the API counterpart of the earlier CLI (OOP) Expense Tracker, developed as a personal learning project to deepen understanding of backend development, API design, and clean project structuring in Python.

The repository contains two implementations:

A CLI-based OOP version (uploaded earlier)

An API version, located in a separate folder, which exposes expense-tracking functionality via HTTP endpoints


This API version is still evolving and is intended to grow alongside the author’s backend learning journey.



**Key Goals of the API Version**

Transition from command-line interaction to HTTP-based interaction

Practice RESTful API design principles

Separate concerns using modular Python files

Prepare the project for future extensions (authentication, persistence, analytics)


**Project Structure (API Version)**

API_version/
├── __init__.py           # Marks the folder as a Python package
├── main.py               # Application entry point (FastAPI app)
├── user.py               # User-related models / logic
├── expense.py            # Expense models and operations
├── tracker.py            # Core tracking logic / services
├── logger.py             # Logging configuration and helpers
├── requirements.txt      # Project dependencies
└── .gitkeep              # Keeps empty directories tracked in Git



**Technologies Used**

Python 3.x

FastAPI – for building RESTful APIs

Uvicorn – ASGI server for running FastAPI

Pydantic – data validation and schema definition




**Installation**

1. Clone the repository



git clone https://github.com/Variant1740/Expense_Tracker.git
cd Expense_Tracker/API_version

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)



python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install dependencies



pip install -r requirements.txt


**Running the API**

Start the FastAPI development server using Uvicorn:

uvicorn main:app --reload

API will be available at: http://127.0.0.1:8000

Interactive API docs (Swagger UI): http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

Alternative docs (ReDoc): http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc



**Features (Current & Planned)**

**Current**

Expense data modeling

Modular service-based structure

FastAPI-powered endpoints

Automatic API documentation via Swagger UI


**Planned / In Progress**

Persistent storage (database integration)

User-specific expense tracking

Authentication and authorization

Monthly and yearly expense summaries

Data visualization endpoints



**Relationship to the CLI Version**

The CLI Expense Tracker (OOP version) focuses on:

Console-based interaction

Object-Oriented design patterns

File-based persistence


The API version focuses on:

Backend architecture

HTTP request/response lifecycle

Scalability and extensibility


Both versions coexist in this repository to document the evolution of the project.



**Project Status**

Active Development

This project is a personal learning initiative and is not yet production-ready. Structure, endpoints, and internal logic may change as development continues.
