# **Expense Tracker API (FastAPI Version)**

## **Overview**
This project is a **RESTful Expense Tracker API** built with **FastAPI**, designed as the API counterpart of an earlier **CLI-based Expense Tracker (OOP version)**.

The repository contains **two implementations**:

- **CLI (OOP) version** – focused on command-line interaction and object-oriented design.  
- **API version** – exposes expense-tracking functionality via **HTTP endpoints** for easier access and integration.

The **API version** is still under active development and is intended to grow alongside the author’s learning journey in **Python backend development**.

---

## **Key Goals of the API Version**

The main objectives of the **API version** are:

- **Transition from CLI to HTTP-based interaction** – allowing users to interact with the expense tracker via HTTP requests instead of the command line.  
- **Practice RESTful API design principles** – following best practices for designing clean and maintainable APIs.  
- **Separate concerns using modular Python files** – keeping models, services, and endpoints organized for easier development and maintenance.  
- **Prepare for future extensions** – including features like **authentication**, **persistent storage**, and **analytics/reporting**.

## **Project Structure (API Version)**

The **API version** is organized into modular files for clarity and maintainability:

```text
API_version/
├── __init__.py        # Marks the folder as a Python package
├── main.py            # FastAPI application entry point
├── user.py            # User-related models and logic
├── expense.py         # Expense models and operations
├── tracker.py         # Core tracking logic / services
├── logger.py          # Logging configuration and helpers
├── requirements.txt   # Project dependencies
└── .gitkeep           # Keeps empty directories tracked in Git

This structure allows you to **separate concerns** effectively:
- `main.py` handles the **application entry point** and routes  
- `user.py` and `expense.py` define **data models and logic**  
- `tracker.py` contains the **core services and operations**  
- `logger.py` manages **logging configuration and helpers**  
- `requirements.txt` lists all **Python dependencies**

---

## **Technologies Used**

The API version is built using the following technologies:

- **Python 3.x** – the main programming language for backend logic  
- **FastAPI** – for building RESTful APIs efficiently  
- **Uvicorn** – ASGI server used to run the FastAPI application  
- **Pydantic** – for data validation and schema definition  

These technologies together provide a **fast, modular, and type-safe backend framework** for the expense tracker.

---

## **Installation**

Follow these steps to set up the API version locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Variant1740/Expense_Tracker.git
cd Expense_Tracker/API_version

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Linux / macOS
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

3. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

---

## **Running the API**

Start the FastAPI development server using Uvicorn:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload

---

## **API Access & Documentation**

Once the API server is running, you can access:

- **API base URL:** `http://127.0.0.1:8000`  
- **Swagger UI (interactive API documentation):** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`  
- **ReDoc (alternative API documentation):** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc`

---

## **Features**

**Current Features**
- Expense data modeling  
- Modular service-based structure  
- FastAPI-powered endpoints  
- Automatic API documentation via Swagger UI  

**Planned / In Progress**
- Persistent storage (database integration)  
- User-specific expense tracking  
- Authentication and authorization  
- Monthly and yearly expense summaries  
- Analytics and reporting endpoints

---

## **Relationship to the CLI Version**

**CLI Expense Tracker**
- Console-based interaction  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- File-based persistence  

**API Version**
- Backend architecture  
- HTTP request/response lifecycle  
- Scalability and extensibility  

Both versions coexist in this repository to **document the evolution of the project**.

## **Project Status**

 **Active Development**  

This project is a **personal learning initiative** and is not yet production-ready. Structure, endpoints, and internal logic may change as development continues.
