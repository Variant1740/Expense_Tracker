("""# Expense Tracker API (FastAPI Version)

Overview

This project is a RESTful Expense Tracker API built with FastAPI, complementing an earlier CLI-based Expense Tracker (OOP version).

The repository contains two implementations:

CLI (OOP) version – console-based, object-oriented design

API version – exposes expense-tracking functionality via HTTP endpoints


The API version is still evolving alongside the author’s backend learning journey.

Key Goals

Transition from CLI to HTTP-based interaction

Practice RESTful API design principles

Separate concerns using modular Python files

Prepare for future extensions (authentication, persistence, analytics)

Technologies Used

Python 3.x

FastAPI – for building RESTful APIs

Uvicorn – ASGI server for running FastAPI

Pydantic – data validation and schema definition


Installation

1. Clone the repository:



git clone https://github.com/Variant1740/Expense_Tracker.git
cd Expense_Tracker/API_version

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:



python -m venv venv
# Linux / macOS
source venv/bin/activate
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install dependencies:



pip install -r requirements.txt

Running the API

Start the FastAPI development server using Uvicorn:

uvicorn main:app --reload

Once running:
