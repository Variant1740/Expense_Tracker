# Expense Tracker (OOP Version)

This is a Python command-line Expense Tracker refactored from a procedural version into a full Object-Oriented Program (OOP). The project uses classes and methods to manage expenses in a cleaner and more scalable structure.

## Features

- Add expenses with category, amount, date, and description
- View expenses in a well-formatted table with fixed-width alignment
- Left-aligned description column for consistent layout
- Save expenses to file
- Load saved expenses
- Optional pie chart visualization using matplotlib
- Organized menu system handled through class methods

## Project Structure

- Expense class: Represents a single expense
- ExpenseTracker class: Handles all program operations (add, view, save, load, charts)

## How to Run

Run the script using:
python expense_tracker.py

Follow the on-screen menu to add or view expenses, save data, or load previous data.
